# Defold-Platformer-Game-Project

Here is my defold 2d platformer project
Was a small project i did which allows a character to move throughout levels avoiding spikes. Also has a main menu that can be navigated through

To run you would have to download defold and then open the project once downloaded

Here are some images from the proejct
